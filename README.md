# AI-Fitness-Trainer-with-RAG

This project is an AI-powered fitness assistant built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The idea was to go beyond generic chatbot responses and create a system that can deliver tailored workout and nutrition advice by grounding its answers in a curated fitness knowledge base.

The trainer combines two core components: a large language model for natural conversation, and a retrieval layer that pulls relevant documents, articles, and guidelines on exercise science and healthy living. When a user asks a question — for example, how to structure a beginner strength routine or what meals support muscle recovery — the system searches its knowledge store and uses those results to generate precise, personalised guidance.

What sets this project apart is the focus on practicality and trustworthiness. Instead of relying solely on an AI model’s memory (which can be vague or inaccurate), the RAG pipeline ensures that responses are tied to real, reliable information. The experience feels like chatting with a personal trainer who not only knows your goals but also cites the science behind their recommendations.

This setup opens the door to many extensions: progress tracking, custom workout planning, or even integration with wearable devices. At its current stage, the project already shows how retrieval-augmented systems can be applied to personal health and fitness, making AI assistants not just conversational but truly useful in everyday life.
